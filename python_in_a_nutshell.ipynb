        "As this introduction will mention and sometimes dip into a lot of topics that are not Python specific but deemed useful programming related information by the author, it is, albeit encouraged, by all means not required to follow every single [link](https://http.cat/204).\n",
        "\n",
        "Especially at the beginning of the introduction, the reader will encounter the use of so called builtins. These are language specific keywords whos definition/meaning is pre-built into the language. `print` for example will display the given text, whereas `type` will display the type of a variable.\n",

        "Python is a [scripting language](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/scripting-language). Where C++ source code needs to be compiled before it can be executed, python source code is being interpreted on the fly.  \n",
        "In C++ the compilation is done by a so called compiler, this is usually [gcc](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gcc). In python the interpretation is done by a so called interpreter, this is usually the [python interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html).  \n",
        "Both compiler and interpreter are just programs. Same as Convertible and Coup√© are just cars.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just as there exist different Convertible/Coup√© versions over the lifespan of a car model, there are also different versions of the compiler or interpreter.\n",
        "While the most recent Python version at time of writing is [3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html), the more commonly used Python version is [3.7](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html). (Usually pyton versions have 3 sets of digits, like `3.7.14`, but the [patch version](https://semver.org/) is not relevant for us)\n",
